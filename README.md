# AI-ML-Research-Lab-
A structured collection of applied machine learning research projects spanning time-series forecasting, regression modeling, anomaly detection, and reinforcement learning.

This repository serves as a centralized research environment where experimentation is conducted with engineering discipline, reproducibility, and clear pathways toward production-grade AI systems.

## Objective

The goal of this lab is to:

Organize machine learning experimentation across core domains

Maintain structured, reproducible workflows

Document modeling decisions and evaluation strategies

Build research artifacts with defined upgrade paths toward deployment

Rather than treating notebooks as isolated experiments, each project is developed with scalability and system-oriented thinking in mind.
